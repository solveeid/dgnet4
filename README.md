# Higher order DGNet: Discrete gradient methods in Hamiltonian neural networks

This code is meant as a supplement to [1], and is an implementation of higher order discrete gradient methods for Hamiltonian neural networks presented there. It builds on Hamiltonian neural networks by Greydanus et al. [2] and DGNet by Matsubara et al [3]. Please refer to [1] if the code is used in a project.
